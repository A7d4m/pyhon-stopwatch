Stopwatch with CustomTkinter
Description
This is a simple stopwatch application built with Python using the tkinter and customtkinter libraries.
It features start, pause, reset, and quit buttons, plus a pin/unpin option to keep the stopwatch window always on top.

The UI is clean and minimalistic with a light blue background and uses custom styled buttons from customtkinter.
